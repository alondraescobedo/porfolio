My professional portfolio
This repository contains the code for my professional portfolio, in which I describe myself, some projects I have done, my skills, and contact information for people who would like to get in touch with me.
For this project, I used basic web development tools to ensure a clean and functional structure. These tools were provided by my professor during the web applications class:
HTML5: Semantic structure of the page.
CSS: Custom styles, Flexbox for design, and animations with `@keyframes`.
Git: Version control for development tracking.
