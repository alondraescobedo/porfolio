      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <h3>Know about the projects that I've developed</h3>
      <p>During my studies I've done many projects, but my bests are:</p>
      <p>1. Capstone project: In this project, a colleague and I developed an idea for a problem in the healthcare sector, using AI. To do this, we conducted extensive research, then drew up requirements, and finally developed a prototype. However, the project is still ongoing, so we will begin developing it further at a later date.</p>
      <p>2. Point of sale: For this project, I developed a Python code in which I created a point of sale. I could add products, their prices, stock, etc. Sales were made as the user requested them, and therefore the stock decreased.</p>
      <p>3. Prototype in figma: This is one of my favorites, in there, I create a protype with an idea of application that I would like to develop, I choose an application that was a platform for watch and create videos of "GRWM" (Get ready with me), wich is a very famous type of videos on Internet</p>
